Intelligent Obstacle Avoidance Cart:
The main components of the cart are: three ultrasonic sensors, a camera stage composed of a steering servo, a motor, a WiFi module, a camera, and three 3.7V lithium batteries.
Function: It can pass through a 3X3 simple maze, scan and take pictures of the "treasure" at the end of the maze with the camera, transfer the video and photos to the device connected to the WiFi (PC, cell phone, etc.) via WiFi, and then exit the maze.
Operation method:
1. Walk the maze: the red button next to the Fi module is the switch to control the status of the cart. Connect the battery, press and hold the red button (it is pressed all the time), the trolley is in standby mode; after placing the trolley at the entrance of the maze, release the button, the trolley enters into the activation state, and starts to travel. The three ultrasonic sensors provide distance information for the cart, and the data is processed on the microcontroller to determine the cart's movement, whether it is to turn, backward, or turn around. After traveling to the end of the labyrinth, the car backs up for a long distance, and then the servo turns continuously at a small angle to scan ahead and capture the "treasure". After shooting, the car turns around and exit the maze.
2.WiFi Module: Power the module with rechargeable battery to make it start, after starting, it sends out WiFi signals, connecting to the WiFi can open its corresponding program, which has a video link. After the computer or cell phone is connected to the WiFi, use the browser to open the link to see the real-time picture of the car camera.
3. Bluetooth module: connected to the microcontroller, it sends the real-time status information of the cart to the device connected to Bluetooth through Bluetooth signal, so that other users and devices can grasp the status of the cart in real time.
